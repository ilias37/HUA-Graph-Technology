The projects has been implemented in python notebook so that it is very easy to run the code.

The "Imports" chapter contains all the packages that need to be added to the runtime environment.

The work was implemented in Google Colab, so it is required that the .txt files of the graphs folder representing some graphs are present in Drive.

To execute the code all shells should be implemented serially

Pay attention to the third cell of the chapter "1st Question" where there is code for the example graphs. Only one line should be uncommented in each execution of the cell.

In case that two lines are uncommented at the same time, then the graph that will be assigned to variable G is the graph that is "lower" in the cell.
